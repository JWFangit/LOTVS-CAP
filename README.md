LOTVS-Cognitive Accident Prediction

We are warmly to release a new benchmark on Accident Prediction in dashcam videos. The benchmark is called as CAP-DATA, which consists of 11,727 videos with 2.19 million frames. The fact- effect-reason-introspection description for each accident video is annotated, which consists of the factual description before accident, categorical accident description, accident reason description and preventive advice description. To our best knowledge, it is the largest accident prediction benchmark in driving scenarios.

In addition, we also propose a new model to fulfill a Cognitive Accident Prediction (CAP), which explores the human cognition clues to assist accident prediction in driving videos. Particularly, we explore the text description before accident and the driver attention in driving situations to boost the explainability of accident prediction model, which has the apparent semantic guidance for the object to be involved in accident and helps to find the crashing object efficiently. Extensive experiments shows that the proposed method can obtain larger Time-to-Accident (TTA) than other state-of-the-arts.

The benchmark and the model code can be reviewed in following site.
